# Jupyter Notebook Desktop Alerts

Get prominent desktop-level alerts when your Jupyter notebooks complete or encounter errors!

Perfect for long-running notebooks where you want to be notified when execution finishes - **even when VS Code is hidden or minimized**.

## ✨ Features

- 🟢 **Green flashing alerts** for successful completion
- 🔴 **Red flashing alerts** for errors (automatically detected!)
- 🖥️ **Desktop-level alerts** - visible even when VS Code is hidden
- 🔊 **System sounds** and macOS notifications
- ✅ **No kernel crashes** - alerts run in separate process
- 🚀 **Zero configuration** - works from any directory
- 🎯 **Automatic error detection** - no try/except blocks needed!

## 🎬 Demo

When your notebook completes successfully:
- **Green flashing window** appears on top of all apps
- "Glass" sound plays
- macOS notification banner
- Auto-closes after 12 seconds

When an error occurs:
- **Red flashing window** appears automatically
- "Basso" alert sound
- Shows error type and message
- No need for try/except blocks!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. Download the files:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jupyter-notebook-alerts/main/notebook_auto_alert.py
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jupyter-notebook-alerts/main/_show_alert.py
   ```

2. Place them in your project directory (or anywhere in your Python path)

### Usage

**Add to your notebook:**

```python
# Cell 1 - Import (enables automatic error detection)
from notebook_auto_alert import done

# Cell 2, 3, 4... - Your code
# Any errors here will automatically trigger RED alert!
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
# ... your analysis ...

# Last Cell - Trigger success alert
done("Analysis complete! Processed 10,000 rows")
```

**That's it!** You now have:
- ✅ Automatic **red alerts** if any cell errors
- ✅ **Green alert** when `done()` is called
- ✅ Desktop notifications you can't miss!

## 📖 Detailed Usage

### Success Alerts

```python
from notebook_auto_alert import done

# Basic usage
done()

# With custom message
done("Training complete! Accuracy: 95%")

# After long computation
train_model()  # Takes 2 hours
done("Model training finished!")
```

### Error Alerts (Automatic!)

Errors are automatically detected - no try/except needed:

```python
from notebook_auto_alert import done

# Any error in ANY cell automatically triggers red alert
result = 100 / 0  # ZeroDivisionError → automatic RED alert!
```

### Manual Error Alerts

If you want to manually trigger error alerts:

```python
from notebook_auto_alert import error

if not validate_data():
    error("Data validation failed!")
```

## 💻 Requirements

- **macOS** (uses macOS notification system)
- **Python 3.7+**
- **tkinter** (included with Python on macOS)

No additional dependencies needed! Works with:
- VS Code with Jupyter extension
- JupyterLab
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🎯 Use Cases

Perfect for:
- **Long-running ML training** - Get alerted when training completes
- **Data processing pipelines** - Know when ETL jobs finish
- **Scientific computations** - Don't check back every 5 minutes
- **Multiple notebooks** - Work on other things while notebooks run
- **Background execution** - Minimize VS Code and get notified when done

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Import triggers auto-error detection** - hooks into IPython exception handler
2. **Errors automatically show red alerts** - no code changes needed
3. **Call `done()` for success** - triggers green alert
4. **Alerts run in separate process** - no kernel blocking or crashes
5. **Desktop-level notifications** - always visible

## 📁 Files

- `notebook_auto_alert.py` - Main module (import this in notebooks)
- `_show_alert.py` - Alert display script (don't call directly)
- `example.ipynb` - Example notebook with usage demonstrations

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Alert doesn't appear:**
- Make sure both `notebook_auto_alert.py` AND `_show_alert.py` are in the same directory
- Check console output for any warnings

**Kernel crashes:**
- This should NOT happen in the latest version (uses subprocess)
- If it does, please open an issue!

**Not working in Jupyter Notebook/Lab:**
- Should work fine! The automatic error detection requires IPython/Jupyter
- Make sure you're importing the module in a code cell
